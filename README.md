# HW1-CODE-REFRACTOR

The purpose of the project is to make the client's web page accessible and more SEO friendly without changing the appearance.

This was done by replacing the majority of the div elements with semantic html tags.

Once the tags were switched subsquently the CSS needed to be corrected. 

Several classes were consolidated or removed. New classes/id's were created. Flex model used to positon some elements.

As a result, the coding is now semantic and stylesheet is simpler and cleaner. Appearance has not been altered.
